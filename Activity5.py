#There are five trees in Jack's front yard. He checks each tree to find out how tall it is in inches and writes the height on a sheet of paper. Jack's list: 98, 94, 41, 96, and 11. What is the average height of a tree in Jack's front yard?

tree_no1=98
tree_no2=94
tree_no3=41
tree_no4=96
tree_no5=11     

avj=(tree_no1+tree_no2+tree_no3+tree_no4+tree_no5)/5

print(avj)
